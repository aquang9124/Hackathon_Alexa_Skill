# Hackathon_May

We used Amazon Alexa and configured it to respond to a command and call 911 in case of an emergency. 
The twillio api was used in conjunction with Alexa and Lambda using AWS.

If you say "take everything", "steal my stuff", "leave me alone", or "take whatever you want". The CallEmergencyIntent will be activated and 911 will be alerted.

If you say "you can have anything", "my stuff is cheap", "I am not rich", or "this is all I have", the TextAFriendIntent will be activated and a friend will be notified that you are being robbed.
